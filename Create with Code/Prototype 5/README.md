[Challenge 5 - Whack-a-Food](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/challenge-5-whack-a-food-with-wacky-ui)  
- Center the text on the buttons horizontally and vertically
  - Hint - If you expand one of the button objects in the hierarchy, you’ll see a “Text” object inside - you have to edit the properties of that “Text” object
- The food should only be destroyed when the player clicks on it, not when the mouse touches it
  - Hint - OnMouseEnter() detects when the mouse enters an object’s collider - OnMouseDown() detects when the mouse clicks on an object’s collider
- It should always say, “Score: __“ with the value displayed after “Score:”
  - Hint - When you set the score text, you have to add (concatenate) the word “Score: “ and the actual score value
- Make the Restart button appear on the game over screen
  - Hint - In the GameOver() method, make sure the restart button is being reactivated
- The spawnRate is always way too fast. When you click Easy, the spawnRate should be slower - if you click Hard, the spawnRate should be faster.
  - Hint - There is no information (or parameter) being passed from the buttons’ script to the Game Manager’s script - you need to implement a difficulty parameter
- Bonus - Add a “Time: __” display that counts down from 60 in whole numbers (i.e. 59, 58, 57, etc) and triggers the game over sequence when it reaches 0.
  - Hint - Google, “Unity Count down timer C#”. It will involve subtracting “Time.deltaTime” and using the Mathf.Round() method to display only whole numbers.
