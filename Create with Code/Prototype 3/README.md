[Challenge 3 - Balloons, Bombs, & Booleans](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/challenge-3-bouncy-balloons-bombs-and-booleans  
- The balloon should float up as the player presses spacebar
  - Hint - There is a “NullReferenceExcepton” error on the player’s rigidBody variable - it has to be assigned in Start() using the GetComponent<> method
- The background should move at start, then stop when the game is over
  - Hint - In MoveLeftX.cs, the objects should only Translate to the left if the game is NOT over
- Make bombs or money objects spawn every few seconds
  - Hint - There is an error message saying, “Trying to Invoke method: SpawnManagerX.PrawnsObject couldn't be called” - spelling matters
- Make the fireworks display at the balloon’s position
  - Hint - The fireworks particle is a child object of the Player - but its location still has to be set at the same location
- Make the background repeat seamlessly
  - Hint - The repeatWidth variable should be half of the background’s width, not half of its height
- Bonus - Prevent the player from floating their balloon too high
  - Hint - Add a boolean to check if the balloon isLowEnough, then only allow the player to add upwards force if that boolean is true
- Bonus - Make the balloon appear to bounce off of the ground, preventing it from leaving the bottom of the screen. There should be a sound effect when this happens, too!
  - Hint - Figure out a way to test if the balloon collides with the ground object, then add an impulse force upward if it does

[Bonus Features 3 - Share your Work](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/bonus-features-3-share-your-work)  
- Easy: Randomize obstacles
  - Convert the prefab holder inside the SpawnManager to an array.
- Medium: Double jump
  - Try using a boolean to limit the player to double-jumping once
- Hard: Dash ability and score
  - Try using a boolean to determine whether the player is running fast
- Expert: Game start animation
  - Try lerping the players position.
