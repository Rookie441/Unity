[Unit 1 - Player Control](https://learn.unity.com/project/unit-1-driving-simulation)  
- New Functionality
  - Project set up with assets imported
  - Vehicle positioned at the start of the road
  - Obstacle positioned in front of the vehicle
  - Camera positioned behind vehicle
  - Vehicle moves down the road at a constant speed
  - When the vehicle collides with obstacles, they fly into the air
  - Camera follows the vehicle down the road at a set offset distance
  - When the player presses the up/down arrows, the vehicle will move forward and backward
  - When the player presses the left/right arrows, the vehicle turns

[Challenge 1 - Plane Programming](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/challenge-1-steer-a-plane-through-obstacles-in-the-sky)  
- Make the plane go forward
  - Hint: Vector3.back makes an object move backwards, Vector3.forward makes it go forwards
- Slow the plane down to a manageable speed
  - Hint: If you multiply a value by Time.deltaTime, it will change it from 1x/frame to 1x/second
- Make the plane tilt only if the user presses the up/down arrows
  - Hint: In PlaneController.cs, in Update(), the verticalInput value is assigned, but it’s never actually used in the Rotate() call
- Reposition it so it’s beside the plane
  - Hint: For the camera’s position, try X=30, Y=0, Z=10 and for the camera’s rotation, try X=0, Y=-90, Z=0
- Make the camera follow the plane
  - Hint: In FollowPlane.cs, neither the plane nor offset variables are assigned a value - assign the plane variable in the camera’s inspector and assign the offset = new Vector3(30, 0, 10) in the code
- Bonus - Make the propeller spin
  - Hint: There is a “Propeller” child object of the plane - you should create a new “SpinPropellerX.cs” script and make it rotate every frame around the Z axis.  

[Bonus Features 1 - Share your Work](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/bonus-features-1-share-your-work)  
- Easy: Obstacle pyramids
  - Remember to use a Rigidbody!
- Medium: Oncoming vehicles
  - Try using transform.Translate to move the other vehicles.
- Hard: Camera switcher
  - Add a second camera and then use a key press to enable and disable it.
- Expert: Local multiplayer
  - You will need to edit the Input Manager and the Camera’s Viewport Rect Width property.
