[Unit 4 - Gameplay Mechanics](https://learn.unity.com/project/unit-4-gameplay-mechanics)  
- New Functionality
  - Camera rotates around the island based on horizontal input
  - Player rolls in direction of camera based on vertical input
  - Enemy spawns at random location on the island
  - Enemy follows the player around
  - Spheres bounce off of each other
  - When the player collects a powerup, a visual indicator appears
  - When the player collides with an enemy while they have the powerup, the enemy goes flying
  - After a certain amount of time, the powerup ability and indicator disappear
  - Enemies spawn in waves
  - The number of enemies spawned increases after every wave is defeated
  - A new power up spawns with every wave
- New Concepts & Skills
  - Texture Wraps
  - Camera as child object
  - Global vs Local coordinates
  - Get direction of other object
  - Physics Materials
  - Defining vectors in 3D space
  - Normalizing values
  - Methods with return values
  - Debug concatenation
  - Local component variables
  - IEnumerators and WaitForSeconds()
  - Coroutines
  - SetActive(true/false)
  - For-loops
  - Increment (++) operator
  - Custom methods with parameters
  - FindObjectsOfType

[Challenge 4 - Soccer Scripting](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/challenge-4-soccer-scripting)  
- When you hit an enemy, it should send it away from the player
  - Hint - In PlayerControllerX.cs, to get a Vector away from the player, you should subtract the [enemy position] minus the [player’s position] - not the reverse
- A new wave should spawn when all enemy balls have been removed
  - Hint - In SpawnManagerX.cs, check that the enemyCount variable is being set correctly
- The powerup should only last for a certain duration, then disappear
  - Hint - In PlayerControllerX.cs, the PowerupCoolDown Coroutine code looks good, but this coroutine is never actually called with the StartCoroutine() method
- One enemy should be spawned in wave 1, two in wave 2, three in wave 3, etc
  - Hint - In SpawnManagerX.cs, the for-loop that spawns enemy should make use of the enemiesToSpawn parameter
- The enemy balls should go towards the “Player Goal” object
  - Hint - There is an error in EnemyX.cs: “NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object”. It looks like the playerGoal object is never assigned.
- Bonus - The player should get a speed boost whenever the player presses spacebar - and a particle effect should appear when they use it
  - Hint - In PlayerController, add a simple if-statement that adds an “impulse” force if spacebar is pressed. To add a particle effect, first attach it as a child object of the Focal Point.
- Bonus - The enemies’ speed should increase in speed by a small amount with every new wave
  - Hint - You’ll need to track and increase the enemy speed in SpawnManagerX.cs. Then in EnemyX.cs, reference that speed variable and set it in Start().

[Bonus Features 4 - Share your Work](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/bonus-features-4-share-your-work)  
- Easy: Harder enemy
  - Try using an array for the enemy prefabs.
- Medium: Homing rockets
  - Try using an enum to differentiate the power ups
- Hard: Smashingly good
  - Extend the enum you created in the previous challenge
- Expert: Boss battle
  - Create a new SpawnBossWave function that only runs if the wave number is a multiple of a particular value.
